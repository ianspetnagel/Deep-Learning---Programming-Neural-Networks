This project was programming Neural Networks Using PyTorch.
The mutiple .py files within the project all relate to different features of machine learning.

I covered:
Learning Regression, 
Function Approximation with Auto Grad, 
Using Neural Network to do the Sine Wave Regression, 
Full Regression of Sine function using a Neural Network,
Activation Function - Torch.nn.ReLU,
Sigmoid Function  - torch.nn.Sigmoid.
